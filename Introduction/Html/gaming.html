    <h1>This page is about Gaming, it is one of Jadon's interests</h1>
 <p> A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device 
    (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion-sensing device) to generate visual feedback from a display device,
    most shown in video format on a television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices,
    or a virtual reality headset, as the name implies. Not all video games, however, require graphical output; for example,
    text adventure games and computer chess may be played with teletype printers. Most current video games are audiovisual, 
    with music given by speakers or headphones and, in some cases, other forms of sensory feedback (for example, haptic technology 
    that offers tactile sensations), while some video games also enable microphone and controller input.
    Video games are typically categorized according to their hardware platform, which traditionally includes arcade video games, console games,
    and computer (PC) games; the latter also encompasses LAN games, online games, and browser games. More recently, the video game industry has
    expanded onto mobile gaming through mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablet computers), virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote 
    cloud gaming. Video games are also classified into a wide range of genres based on their style of gameplay and target audience</p> 
    <h2>Computer Games</h2>
    <p>
        Most computer games are PC games, referring to those that involve a player interacting with a personal computer (PC) connected to a video monitor.
        Personal computers are not dedicated game platforms, so there may be differences running the same game on different hardware. Also, the openness allows
        some features to developers like reduced software cost,[ increased flexibility, increased innovation, emulation, creation of modifications or mods, 
        open hosting for online gaming (in which a person plays a video game with people who are in a different household) and others. A gaming computer is 
        a PC or laptop intended specifically for gaming, typically using high-performance, high-cost components. In additional to personal computer gaming,
        there also exist games that work on mainframe computers and other similarly shared systems, with users logging in remotely to use the computer.

    <h2>Home Console</h2>
    <p> 
        A console game is played on a home console, a specialized electronic device that connects to a common television set or composite video monitor.
        Home consoles are specifically designed to play games using a dedicated hardware environment, giving developers a concrete hardware target for 
        development and assurances of what features will be available, simplifying development compared to PC game development. Usually consoles only run
        games developed for it, or games from other platform made by the same company, but never games developed by its direct competitor, even if the same
        game is available on different platforms. It often comes with a specific game controller. Major console platforms include Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo.

    <h2>Mobile Games</h2>
    <p>
        With the introduction of smartphones and tablet computers standardized on the iOS and Android operating systems, mobile gaming has become a significant platform.
        These games may use unique features of mobile devices that are not necessary present on other platforms, such as accelerometers, global positing information 
        and camera devices to support augmented reality gameplay.
