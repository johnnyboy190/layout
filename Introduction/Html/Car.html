        <h2>Subaru</h2>
        <p>It was the early ’90s, and the world was moving past the earlier gas crisis. Japanese automakers were known for their efficient small-displacement engines,
            but something was still left to be desired. There wasn’t any appeal beyond driving something practical. 
            And sales were soft. Then, Subaru smashed a world speed record by holding 139 mph for 448 hours, and the rest is pretty much history.
            The 2004 Subaru STI was the first year of the WRX in North America. It brought a racer’s edge to daily driving and has since become an icon.
            How could it not? After all, that unmistakable body was designed by Peter Stevens: the draftsman behind the McLaren F1 supercar. 
            Let’s dig deeper and see what makes this member of the Subaru Impreza STI family tree so unique.You don’t need more than five minutes behind the wheel of 
            this particular Subaru Impreza STI to know what it was built for – speed, control, and laughs. There aren’t many cars out there that bring us back to those blissful
            soap-box racers of our youth where all you had was a steep hill, fighter-pilot goggles, and a few cheering friends as crazy as you.
            The race-designed seats are just barely comfortable. The interior is spartan from any modern niceties. The rear bench might as well not even be there. 
            But who cares. The second you are thrust into the driver’s seat under the force of a perfectly balanced powerband is all that matters.

        <h2>Toyota Supra</h2>
        <p>Toyota Supra is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. 
        The Supra traces much of its roots back to the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout. 
        The first three generations were offered with a direct descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M engine.
        Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code "A". 
        Along with this name, Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra.
        It was derived from the original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. 
        This logo was used until January 1986, when the A70 Supra was introduced. 
        The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but without the dragon design.
        That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval company logo. 
        The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what colour it was. 
        It appeared on the first two generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas. 
        The dragon logo was used for the Celica line until it was also discontinued. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra</a>

       <h2>Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution</h2>
       <p>Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is a sports sedan and rally car based on the Lancer that was manufactured by Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi 
        Motors from 1992 until 2016. There have been ten official versions to date, and the designation of each model is
        most commonly a Roman numeral. All generations use two-litre intercooled turbo inline four-cylinder engines and
        all-wheel drive systems.
        The Evolution was originally intended only for Japanese markets, but demand on the "grey import" market led the
        Evolution series to be offered through Ralliart dealer networks in the United Kingdom and in various European markets 
        from around 1998. Mitsubishi decided to export the eighth generation Evolution to the United States in 2003 after witnessing 
        the success Subaru had in that market the previous year with the Subaru Impreza WRX.
        All domestic market versions, until the release of the Evolution IX in 2005, were limited by a gentlemen's
        agreement between Japanese car manufacturers to advertise no more than 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp). However, sources
        say Mitsubishi had already been producing cars with more power but had been underrating the official power outputs
        in order to comply with the agreement.[3] Therefore, each subsequent version has unofficially evolved above the advertised
        power figures, with the Japanese-market Evolution IX reaching an alleged output of around 321 PS (236 kW; 317 hp). 
        Various special versions available in other markets, particularly the UK, have official power outputs up to 446 PS 
        (328 kW; 440 hp).
        The tenth and final generation of the Lancer Evolution, the Evolution X, was launched in Japan in 2007, and overseas markets in 2008.
        Evolution X was produced for almost 10 years until Mitsubishi retired the Lancer Evolution in April 2016. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Lancer_Evolution">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Lancer_Evolution</a>
