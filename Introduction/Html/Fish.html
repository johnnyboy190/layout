        <h1>This page speaks about fishing, this is one of Jonathan's Interest</h1>
        <p>
            On this page I will be speaking and showing about the different types of fishes I know about and my experience from fishing. <br>
            My fishing experience started at the age of 19, when I caught my first fish.
            My first attempt of fishing was with 'bottle and line', <br> because of my lack of knowledge of setting up and usage of a fishing
            rod. <br> However I still managed to catch my first fish with bottle and line. <br>

        <h2>The Red Snapper</h2>
        <img src="../media/fish/red_snapper.png" alt="" class="pics">
        <p>
            My first fish I caught was a red snapper from the rocky Jetty. I casught this using
            bottle and line and with little experince. <br>
            The northern red snapper is a species of marine ray-finned
            fish, a snapper belonging to the family Lutjanidae. It is native to the 
            western Atlantic Ocean, <br> the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico, where it inhabits 
            environments associated with reefs. It has a sweet, mild but unique flavor. It has a peculiarly fresh, <br> almost 
            nutty flavor. Red snapper 
            flesh is considered delicious and the throats are considered a delicacy. It is one of the most sought-after 
            offshore fish. <br>

        <h2 id="jacks">Jack cravelle</h2>
        <img src="../media/fish/jack.png" alt="" class="pics">
        <p>
            The moment I caught my Favourite fish was a time when I was fishing alone a late night on a Jetty. 
            At the time I had already had a rod which was given to me as a gift by Abigail. The name of the fish
            I caught is called a Jack crevalle, It was and still is up to this day
            the strongest fish I hooked. That was the first time I had a fish bend my rod and put on a good fight. <br>
            The crevalle jack, also known as the common jack, black-tailed trevally, couvalli jack, black cavalli, jack 
            crevale, or yellow cavalli is a common species of large marine fish classified within the jack family, Carangidae. <br> The crevalle jack is distributed across the tropical and temperate waters of the Atlantic Ocean, 
            ranging from Nova Scotia, Canada to Uruguay in the western Atlantic and Portugal
            to Angola in the eastern Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea. <br>

        <h1 class="fish_h1">Fishes I want to catch</h1>
        <p><strong>The two fishing I really want to catch are: </strong></p>  
            <ul>
                <li>Yellow-fin</li>
                <li>Blue Marlin</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Yellowfin Tuna</h2>
        <img src="../media/fish/yellow_fin.png" alt="" class="pics">
        <p>
            I like myself a nice Yellow-fin Tuna not only of the size but the fight, taste and fun of catching this fish.
            For me to catch one of these, I must be out far in the deep waters...the deep dangerous waters, which I will be in 
            one day. The yellowfin tuna is a highly prized food fish and is fished heavily throughout its range. 
            Generally, scientists believe that these fisheries are managed fairly well, and the species is not 
            considered overfished. However, there are some populations that are fished more heavily than others,
            and it is important to continue to monitor these activities in order to prevent fishing levels that
            could threaten this iconic, powerful species. <br>

        </p>
        <h2>Blue Marlin</h2>
        <img src="../media/fish/blue_marlin.png" alt="" class="pics">
        <p>
            The blue Marlin is my second favourite fish that I want to catch. This fish is also a difficult fish to catch,
            the fish is also out in the deep waters. Blue marlin live throughout tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian, 
            Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. What I observe from this fish is it's long, pointy and dangerous nose which can facture or 
            even kill you by trying to catch it, and this one of the reason I want to catch it. <strong>The challenge.</strong>
        </p>
        <h2>My favourite fishing moment</h2>
        <p>
            My favourite fishing moment is at the when I caught a <a href="#jacks"> Jack cravelle</a> at night time, but That
            isnt the reason it was my favourite moment.
            That night I was all alone fishing with lots of bait and excitment. The moment I cast my line in water, I was catching
            fish from then until after mid-night. <br> That night I caught about twenty fish and it fed the family well. For now my fishing level is 
            basic but will be advanced over time.

        <h1>A fish to mention</h1>
        <h2>THE GROUPER</h2>
        <img src="../media/fish/grouper.png" alt="" class="pics">
        <p>Veiwing this fish size from a photo is nothing compared to what it looks like in real life.
            One of the largest and best-known of the groupers is the goliath grouper (E. itajara), which
            can reach a length of 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) and a weight of about 455 kg (1,000 pounds). The black, or
            Warsaw, grouper (E. nigritus, also classified as Hyporthodus nigritus), of the Atlantic, is another large 
            species. Adult black groupers can grow to 2.3 metres (7.5 feet) in length and weigh nearly 200 kg
            (440 pounds). Grayish or brownish in colour, it is the only grouper with 10 dorsal spines.
            Other well-known species include the golden-striped grouper (Grammistes sexlineatus), an
            Indo-Pacific fish about 25 cm (10 inches) long, marked with rows of dashes when young but 
            black or brown with lengthwise yellow stripes as an adult; the Nassau grouper, an abundant Caribbean
            food fish about 90 cm (35 inches) long, varying in colour from white, with or without darker markings, 
            to dark brown or gray-brown; the red grouper (E. morio), another Caribbean food fish, usually reddish 
            with pale blotches and up to 125 cm (about 49 inches) long; and the rock hind (E. adscensionis),
            an Atlantic food species spotted with orange or red and up to 61 cm (24 inches)long. <br> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/grouper">https://www.britannica.com/animal/grouper</a> <br> <br>
